Japan began defence of their Asian Cup title with a lucky 2-1 win against Syria in a Group C championship match on Friday.
But China saw their luck desert them in second match of group , crashing to a surprise 2-0 defeat to newcomers Uzbekistan.
China controlled most of match and saw several chances missed until 78th minute when striker Igor Shkvyrin took advantage of a misdirected defensive header to lob ball over advancing keeper and into an empty net.
Oleg Shatskiku made sure of win in injury time , hitting an unstoppable left foot shot from just outside area.
former (-[-37.616666666667/55.75/15180-]-) Soviet was playing in an Asian Cup finals tie for first time.
Despite winning Asian Games title two years ago , Uzbekistan are in finals as outsiders.
Two goals from defensive errors in last six minutes allowed Japan to come from behind and collect all three points from their opening meeting against Syria.
Takuya Takagi scored winner in 88th minute , rising to head a Hiroshige Yanagimoto cross towards goal which goalkeeper Salem Bitar appeared to have covered but then allowed to slip into net.
It was second costly blunder by Syria in four minutes.
Defender Hassan Abbas rose to intercept a long ball into area in 84th minute but only managed to divert it into top corner of Bitar 's goal.
Nader Jokhadar had given Syria lead with a well-struck header in seventh minute.
Japan then laid siege to penalty area for most of game but rarely breached defence.
Bitar pulled off fine saves whenever they did.
Japan coach Shu Kamo said : ' ' own goal proved lucky for us.
scored early and then played defensively and adopted long balls which made it hard for us.'
'
(-[-136.0/35.0/17-]-) Japan , co-hosts of World Cup in 2002 and ranked 20th in world by (-[-+8.5744444444444/47.381388888889/253414+-]-) FIFA

A minute later , Bitar produced a good double save , first from Kazuyoshi Miura 's header and then blocked a Takagi follow-up shot.
Bitar saved well again from Miura in 37th minute , parrying away his header from a corner.

on Saturday.
Little has opted not to risk aggravating knee injury which ruled him out of a large chunk of tour and is replaced by fellow (-[-143.0/-23.0/36074-]-) Queenslander Daniel Herbert.
Owen Finegan has recovered from knocks he took in last weekend 's test against Wales and retains his place in back-row ahead of Daniel Manu.
Wallabies have their sights set on a 13th successive victory to end their tour with a 100 percent record but also want to turn on style and provide David Campese with a fitting send-off in his final match in colours.
Wallabies currently have no plans to make any special presentation to 34-year-old winger but a full house of 75,000 spectators will still gather in hope of witnessing one last moment of magic.
Campese will be up against a familiar foe in shape of Barbarians captain Rob Andrew , who kicked Australia to defeat with a last-ditch drop-goal in World Cup quarter-final in (-[-18.425/-33.925/5465-]-) Cape Town.
" Campo has a massive following in this country and has had public with him ever since he first played here in 1984 , " said Andrew , also likely to be making his final (-[--0.34166666666667/51.456111111111/209725-]-) Twickenham appearance.
On tour , Australia have won all four tests against Italy , Scotland , and Wales , and scored 414 points at an average of almost 35 points a game.
League duties restricted Barbarians ' selectorial options but they still boast 13 internationals including (-[--0.11666666666667/51.5/21-]-) England full-back Tim Stimpson and recalled wing Tony Underwood , plus All Black forwards Ian Jones and Norm Hewitt.

Robert Galvin
(-[-144.96138888889/-37.820555555556/3141-]-) MELBOURNE 1996-12-06
Australia gave Brian Lara another reason to be miserable when they beat West Indies by five wickets in opening World Series limited overs match on Friday.
Lara , disciplined for misconduct on Wednesday , was dismissed for five to extend a disappointing run of form on tour.
Australia , who hold a 2-0 lead in five-match test series , overhauled West Indies ' total of 172 all out with eight balls to spare to end a run of six successive one-day defeats.
All-rounder Greg Blewett steered his side to a comfortable victory with an unbeaten 57 in 90 balls to delight of 42,442 crowd.
Man-of-the match Blewett came to wicket with total on 70 for two and hit three fours during an untroubled innings lasting 129 minutes.
His crucial fifth-wicket partnership with fellow all-rounder Stuart Law , who scored 21 , added 71 off 85 balls.
Lara looked out of touch during his brief stay at crease before chipping a simple catch to Shane Warne at mid-wicket.
West Indies tour manager Clive Lloyd has apologised for Lara 's behaviour on Tuesday.
He ( Lara ) had told Australia coach Geoff Marsh that wicketkeeper Ian Healy was unwelcome in visitors ' dressing room.
(-[-144.96138888889/-37.820555555556/3141-]-) Melbourne crowd were clearly angered by incident , loudly jeering West Indies vice-captain as he walked to middle.
It was left to fellow left-hander Shivnarine Chanderpaul to hold innings together with a gritty 54 despite handicap of an injured groin.
Chanderpaul was forced to rely on a runner for most of his innings after hurting himself as he scurried back to his crease to avoid being run out.
Pakistan , who arrive in (-[-135.0/-25.0/408-]-) Australia later this month , are team competing in World Series tournament.

West Indies batsman Brian Lara suffered another blow to his tour , after already being disciplined for misconduct , when he was dismissed cheaply in first limited overs match against Australia on Friday.
Lara , who earned a stern rebuke from his own tour management after an angry outburst against Australia wicketkeeper Ian Healy , scored five to prolong a run of poor form with bat.
West Indies vice-captain struggled for timing during his 36-minute stay at crease before chipping a ball from medium pacer Tom Moody straight to Shane Warne at mid-wicket.
West Indies were 53 for two in 15 overs when rain stopped play at (-[-144.98333333333/-37.82/330136-]-) Melbourne Cricket Ground after captain Courtney Walsh won toss and elected to bat.
Lara 's outburst three days ago has clearly turned some of public against him.
As he walked to wicket he was greeted by loud jeers from sections of crowd.
On several occasions during his innings , crowd joined together in a series of obscene chants against him.
Tour manager Clive Lloyd on Wednesday apologised for Lara 's behaviour in confronting Australia coach Geoff Marsh in opposition dressing room to protest against his dismissal in second test on Tuesday.
Lloyd did not say what form discipline would take.
Lara , who holds record for highest score in test and first-class cricket , was unhappy about Healy 's role in incident and questioned whether ball had carried to Australia keeper.
Australia went on to win match at (-[-151.22472222222/-33.891666666667/856393-]-) Sydney Cricket Ground by 124 runs to take a two-nil lead in five-test series after Lara failed in both innings.
Lara has yet to score a century since West Indies arrived in (-[-135.0/-25.0/408-]-) Australia five weeks ago.
Both West Indies and Australia team management have played down incident , stressing that relations between two sides have not been adversely affected.
Pakistan , who arrive next week , are third team in triangular World Series tournament.

injury-plagued Indianapolis Colts lost another quarterback on Thursday but last year 's AFC finalists rallied together to shoot down Philadelphia Eagles 37-10 in a showdown of playoff contenders.
Marshall Faulk rushed for 101 yards and two touchdowns and Jason Belser returned an interception 44 yards for a score as Colts improved to 8-6 , same mark as Eagles , who lost for fourth time in five games.
Paul Justin , starting for sidelined Jim Harbaugh , was 14-of-23 for 144 yards and a touchdown for Colts , who played their last home game of season.
Indianapolis closes with games at (-[--94.583333333333/39.05/41819-]-) Kansas and (-[-+-84.5/39.133333333333/43196+-]-) Cincinnati

Third-stringer Kerwin Bell , a 1988 draft choice of Miami Dolphins , made his NFL debut and was 5-of-5 for 75 yards , including a 20-yard scoring strike to Marvin Harrison in third period.
A 39-yard interference penalty against Philadelphia 's Troy set up Faulk 's first score around left end that capped an 80-yard march 5:17 into game and rout was on.
Eagles quarterback Ty Detmer was 17-of-34 for 182 yards before he was benched.
Ricky Watters , who leads NFC in rushing , left game after getting kneed to helmet after gaining 33 yards on seven carries.

Along with leaders Vicenza , fourth-placed Bologna represent biggest surprise of this autumn.

AC Milan ( 9 ) v Udinese ( 11 ) 1330

Following their midweek Champions ' League elimination by side (-[-10.402222222222/63.411388888889/186785-]-) Rosenborg , a morale-boosting win is badly needed.

Good news for Milan is that Udinese 's striker Oliver Bierhoff is out through injury.
Napoli ( 5 ) v Verona ( 17 ) 1330
In-form Napoli should prove too strong for second from bottom Verona despite absence of their suspended (-[--64.0/-34.0/414-]-) Argentine defender Roberto Ayala.
Verona 's slim chances have been further reduced by a knee injury to their experienced midfielder Eugenio Corini.
Parma ( 14 ) v Atlalanta ( 15 ) 1330
Parma may field signing , (-[-15.466667/45.25/224-]-) Croat midfielder Mario Stanic , in an attempt to lift a miserable season which has seen them go without a win since a 1-0 triumph over Cagliari eight weeks ago.

Not exactly a clash of titans but an intriuguing match nonetheless.
Full strength Vicenza , led by Marcelo Otero , may continue their surprise run at top against an Inter side that has been less than impressive in three successive home draws.
Inter will be without suspended defender Joceyln Angloma and injured striker Ivan Zamorano.

killings came just hours after violence monitors said they were not optimistic of a peaceful festive season in (-[-31.0/-29.0/81725-]-) KwaZulu-Natal and pointed where 18 people were massacred last as one of potential hot spots.
They said recent lull in political feuding could be upset as thousands of migrant workers , some tense with grudges brewed in cities and keen to settle old scores , flock back to their home villages.

Saturday 's national congress of ruling Civic Party ( ODS ) will discuss making party more efficient and transparent , Foreign Minister and ODS vice-chairman Josef Zieleniec , said on Friday.
" Modernisation and more profesionalism of party 's structure , having financing of party be more transparent ...
are absolutely fundamental , " Zieleniec , who is also vice-premier in government , told Reuters.
He said after June general elections in which ruling three-party coalition lost its parliamentary majority , ODS executive , led by Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus , had developed proposals on these subjects to present at congress on Saturday in second (-[-16.608333333333/49.195277777778/14960-]-) Brno.
" I am convinced , that congress will tackle these proposals , " he said.
ODS , a party in which Klaus often tries to emulate style of former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher , has been in control of politics since winning general elections in 1992.
Zieleniec in summer led calls for party and its leadership to listen to more diverse opinions , a thinly-veiled criticism of Klaus who has spearheaded country 's post-Communist economic reforms.
party , led by vigorously-confident Klaus , took 32 of 81 seats after late November runoff elections to upper house of parliament.
But after first round vote a week before , ODS had potential to win as many 79 seats.
Klaus and his coalition lost its majority in parliament in June lower house elections after left-wing opposition consolidated , putting centre-left Social Democrats in a strong second-place position.

(-[-19.0/52.0/36-]-) Poland said on Friday that bank accounts , which in many cases belonged to Jews who died in Holocaust , were used in debt settlements between two countries after World War Two.
Foreign Minister Dariusz Rosati , unveiling first findings of a special government commission , said that in 1970s then communist (-[-19.0/52.0/36-]-) Poland received 460,000 francs from accounts.
" In 1970s , (-[-19.0/52.0/36-]-) Poland received from unclaimed accounts in (-[-+8.231973/46.798562/39+-]-) Switzerland

from unclaimed bank accounts of citizens , as part of an accord on compensating nationals whose assets had been seized in communist (-[-19.0/52.0/36-]-) Poland.
Many of these citizens were Jews murdered during war , when Nazi invaders killed most of (-[-19.0/52.0/36-]-) Poland 's 3.5 million Jews.
Rosati did not say whether payment in 1970s was part of 1949 agreement between (-[-21.033333333333/52.216666666667/270-]-) Warsaw and (-[-+8.231973/46.798562/39+-]-) Switzerland
on compensation to citizens whose assets were seized by Soviet-imposed communists authorities after World War Two.
" I expect that commission will finish gathering information within two to three weeks and then more details will be provided , " Rosati said.
Rosati confirmed that 1949 agreement had provided for granting (-[-8.231973/46.798562/39-]-) Switzerland about 53 million francs and most of this sum was repaid with coal exports.
He said , however , that (-[-8.231973/46.798562/39-]-) Switzerland did get about 16,000 francs from so-called " dead accounts " as part of compensation.
" About 16,000 francs were seized from accounts of four or five citizens , whose data we do not precisely know.
issue is of moral and legal nature , because its financial significance is small , " Rosati said.
Under pressure from international Jewish organisations , government has devised a plan to pay out millions of dollars in unclaimed bank accounts as a conciliatory gesture toward Holocaust victims.
conservative Radical Democrats ( FDP ) have said they would ask parliament next week to order banks to put some 40 million francs ( $ 31 million ) in dormant wealth into a fund earmarked for Jewish groups and charitable organisations.

brewer Zywiec 's 1996 profit slump may last into next year due in part to hefty depreciation charges , but recent high investment should help firm defend its 10-percent market share , firm 's chief executive said.
Company President Jean van Boxmeer told Reuters in an interview on Friday that firm , whose net profit fell 77 percent in first 10 months of 1996 despite a 30-percent rise in sales , might only post slightly better profits in 1997 before having a chance to make a more significant turnaround.
So far this year Zywiec , whose full name is Zaklady Piwowarskie w Zywcu SA , has netted six million zlotys on sales of 224 million zlotys.
It has produced 1.5 million hectolitres.
Van Boxmeer would not say how much higher 1997 profits or market share could be but said sales of leading brewers should rise as country 's young urban professionals gradually switch from vodka to beer.
" perspective on growth is such that reasonably we can think that somewhere between 65 and 80 litres per year is certainly reachable , " van Boxmeer said on per-capita beer consumption , currently around 40 litres.
He said 65-80-litre level could be reached in next ten years and make (-[-19.0/52.0/36-]-) Poland , with its 40-million population , (-[-+7.0/46.0/46+-]-) Europe
's third largest beer market after (-[-10.0/51.0/183-]-) Germany and.
Van Boxmeer said (-[-19.0/52.0/36-]-) Poland 's top five brewers , which produce about 55 percent of country 's beer , could all raise market share as some of numerous small brewers fall to competition from large brewers with foreign investors.
Zywiec is 31.8-percent owned by Heineken while Carlsberg has same amount in (-[-20.598611111111/49.945277777778/2017377-]-) Okocim.
Earlier this year Breweries Ltd ( SAB ) bought strategic stakes in unlisted Lech and (-[-19.0/50.166666666667/11977-]-) Tychy brewers , which together hold more than 20 percent of market , and (-[-+135.0/-25.0/408+-]-) Australia
's Brewpole BV has a controlling stake in (-[-19.0/52.0/36-]-) Poland 's larges t brewery , Elbrewery Company Ltd. ( EB ).
Van Boxmeer said tough competition had prevented Zywiec from raising prices in line with inflation , which had added to pressure on firm 's margins.
He said advertising costs would also increase in fight for market share.
But he said company 's investment of more than $ 100 million already this decade , largely in production , would help position it to compete with such competitors as brewers from neighbouring.
Some analysts say cheaper but high-quality imports could invade (-[-19.0/52.0/36-]-) Poland once tariffs for CEFTA countries are lifted in 1998 , but van Boxmeer says such a threat might be exaggerated despite beer market 's overcapacity.
" I think consumers in general are quite proud of their beers -- and I 'm speaking about all brands -- and as we make good beers ...
I think that this fidelity to our beers is a factor which can limit beers , " he said.
Van Boxmeer said Zywiec had its eye on Okocim , which has said it would start producing Carlsberg beer next year , but that Zywiec 's potential production of Heineken was a medium-term possibility rather than a short-term one.
He said his firm would be better off concentrating on its leading brand , Zywiec Full Light , which accounts for 85 percent of sales and is country 's largest-selling brand.
" You will not win war of beer market with imported international brands , " van Boxmeer said , adding that Heineken would remain an up-market import in (-[-19.0/52.0/36-]-) Poland.
Van Boxmeer also said Zywiec would be boosted by its recent shedding of soft drinks which only accounted for about three percent of firm 's overall sales and for which 7.6 million zlotys in provisions had already been made.

government warned Friday that it would refer proposed trans-Atlantic alliance between Airways Plc and Airlines to 's Monopolies and Mergers Commission unless carriers complied with a number of conditions.
Trade and Industry Secretary Ian Lang added that even if conditions were met by both airlines , final clearance would hinge on an open skies deal between and to liberalise trans-Atlantic air traffic , which would create greater competition on routes.
Lang said he supported conditions proposed by 's Office of Fair Trading , which was asked to examine case last month.
" I agree ... that without suitable undertakings alliance would be likely to lead to a significant loss of actual and potential passengers , on those routes where BA and AA currently compete and for all passengers on trans-Atlantic market route between and , " he said.
His comments came just minutes after latest set of open skies talks ended in (-[--0.1275/51.507222222222/84-]-) London with no deal signed.
Industry sources said there was no date for fresh talks and blamed deadlock on uncertainty over whether Airways-American deal would be cleared.
conditions for clearance of alliance were that Airways and drop 168 slots at (-[--0.461389/51.4775/8691-]-) London Heathrow airport , busiest in (-[-+7.0/46.0/46+-]-) Europe
.
's parent , AMR Corp. , said it did not view terms as a " deal breaker."
However , it called conditions " more severe " than those imposed by regulatory authorities on similar airline alliances.
Airways 's initial response was that " unconditional divestiture of slots is unprecedented and if done it must be on basis of fair market value."
It added that it would be " prepared to take reasonable steps to assist introduction of additional competition."
government also wants Airways to drop a clause in its agreement with USAir that bars it from competing on trans-Atlantic routes , and said both Airways and should be prepared to reduce services on (-[--0.1275/51.507222222222/84-]-) London to Dallas-Fort Worth route in event that a entrant wishes to enter.
It also suggested losing some slots on London-to-Boston route.

York on Friday said that it planned a $ 775 million refunding for January that will include its first floating rate issue of taxable debt for investors.
A official , who declined to be named , explained that Goldman , Sachs , which this summer was demoted to second tier of syndicate , proposed floating rate issue and as a result was promoted to book runner for this offering.
By selling floating rate debt , hopes to establish a benchmark , official said , adding that it needed a large deal to accomplish this objective.
in late June sold its first issue of Euronotes , a strategy that it says saved it $ 500,000 in interest costs , and it has been trying to build on this strategy of expanding pool of potential investors since then.
In November , York said it became first municipality to offer bonds for sale in markets by competitive bidding as it listed taxable bonds on (-[--0.099/51.515/171240-]-) London Stock Exchange.
refunding planned for January also includes a $ 475 million tax-exempt offering.

Wall St speculates about Santa Fe savior.
Brendan Intindola
YORK 1996-12-06
Homestake Mining Co tops (-[--74.011028/40.706833/13677-]-) Wall Street 's list as most likely white knight buyer for Santa Fe Pacific Gold Corp if Santa Fe rejects unsolicited suitor Newmont Mining Corp.
Santa Fe is so far mum on more than $ 2 billion stock swap takeover proposal from Newmont , announced Thursday.
(-[--74.011028/40.706833/13677-]-) Wall Street , since bid , has speculated that any deal between Newmont and Santa Fe would be a " bear hug , " or a reluctantly negotiated agreement where buyer is not necessarily a friendly suitor.
Newmont said companies have had previous contact , though declined to detail encounters.
Analysts predict Santa Fe will go to highest bidder , and that if a rival buyer is found , Newmont may not be able to match its offer.
They said Santa Fe deal , which includes desirable (-[--117.0/39.0/1227-]-) Nevada mining , would only payoff for Newmont longer term.
Newmont , in fact , will not benefit from Santa Fe acquisition on an earnings basis for at least two years , which also limits its capacity to raise its offer.
Any deal , friendly or hostile , would almost assuredly be a stock swap , which is necessary to preserve tax-free , pooling-of-interest accounting , they said.
Analysts and arbitrageurs immediately ruled out Barrick Gold Corp and Bre-X Minerals Ltd as Santa Fe saviors because they are locked in negotiations over their splitting (-[-118.0/-2.0/252-]-) Indonesia 's Busang vast gold deposit.
Placer Dome Inc too was considered unlikley because it is focusing on geographic expansion in areas that do match Santa Fe 's (-[--117.0/39.0/1227-]-) Nevada , and Asia presence , they said.
A Homestake spokesman was not immediately available to comment on speculation that it tops list.
Homestake , based in (-[--122.433333/37.766667/62-]-) San Francisco , operates gold mines in , (-[-+135.0/-25.0/408+-]-) Australia
, (-[--71.0/-31.0/298-]-) Chile and (-[-+-109.0/56.0/16+-]-) Canada
.
Earnings in 1995 were $ 0.22 per share , or $ 30.3 million , on revenues of $ 746.3 million.
Santa Fe is headquartered (-[--106.61666666667/35.116666666667/34804-]-) Albuquerque , (-[-+-106.0/34.0/1522+-]-) N.M.
and reported 1995 earnings of $ 0.30 per share , or $ 40 million , on revenues of $ 350 million.
Santa Fe has mining and exploration operations in (-[--117.0/39.0/1227-]-) Nevada , (-[-+-120.0/37.0/99+-]-) California
, (-[--110.0/47.0/1212-]-) Montana , (-[-+-109.0/56.0/16+-]-) Canada

.
PaineWebber analyst Marc Cohen said he lowered his rating on Newmont to neutral from attractive today because if Newmont merged with Santa Fe , investors would have to wait until second half of 1998 to realize earnings accretion.
" I think Homestake could come in as a white knight , but how much is someone willing to come in above Newmont number.
One would have to outbid by at least 15 percent , but there is going to be a ( Santa Fe ) deal with someone , " he said.
" Longer term , two to three years out , ( a Newmont-Santa Fe deal ) is positive , it does all right things.
But in near-term it is , at worst , neutral , " analyst added.
Newmont proposed to Santa Fe a stock-swap merger at a ratio of 0.33 Newmont shares for each Santa Fe shares.
In Friday York Stock Exchange trade , Newmonth was off 1/2 to 46-5/8 while Santa Fe added 1/4 to 15-1/8.
" Newmont said it wants to discuss a friendly deal with Santa Fe , which is almost always a euphemism for ' We have more money in our pocket , ' " said an arb , referring to a possible sweetened bid from Newmont.
Two arbs called Newmont 's move a " a 32 cent bid " because there is no formal tender offer , only proposal letter " mailed " to Santa Fe 's board.

general in charge of a multinational force for eastern (-[-23.656/-2.88/974-]-) Zaire said on Friday he was going back to (-[-+23.656/-2.88/974+-]-) Zaire
for more information about plight of about 165,000 refugees adrift in countryside.
Lieutenant-General Maurice Baril told a news conference in (-[-36.816666666667/-1.2833333333333/3870-]-) Nairobi his main concern was for a large group of about 150,000 refugees living off land in a valley about 65 km ( 40 miles ) west of eastern of (-[-+29.22/-1.69/204381+-]-) Goma
.
If he decided it was necessary and safe for aircrew , he would not hesitate to order airdrops of food for refugees , even against wishes of government in (-[-15.313888888889/-4.3316666666667/3838-]-) Kinshasa and (-[-+23.656/-2.88/974+-]-) Zairean
rebels who control much of eastern (-[-23.656/-2.88/974-]-) Zaire , he said.
" Tomorrow I 'm going into (-[-29.873888888889/-1.9402777777778/1037-]-) Rwanda and my intention is to go across into eastern (-[-+23.656/-2.88/974+-]-) Zaire
and try to find out for second time what situation is on ground , " he said.
General Baril saw rebel leader Laurent Kabila in (-[-29.22/-1.69/204381-]-) Goma last week but rebels told him crisis was over because most of refugees have already gone home.
rebels do not want multinational force to deploy on ground , for fear it might help (-[-23.656/-2.88/974-]-) Zairean army regain control of area.
(-[-15.313888888889/-4.3316666666667/3838-]-) Kinshasa opposes airdrops , apparently because food could fall into hands of rebels and their local supporters.
Defence Minister Doug Young said on Thursday that multinational force would probably not have to make food airdrops or intervene militarily in any major way.
" It does n't look as though they ( airdrops ) are going to be required in any significant way because NGOs ( non-governmental organisations ) are in that area on border between (-[-23.656/-2.88/974-]-) Zaire and (-[-+29.873888888889/-1.9402777777778/1037+-]-) Rwanda
, " Young told reporters.
But General Baril said it would be premature to rule out any course of action until he had more information.
" We hope that if front moves forward or stabilises then we will have access ( to large group of refugees ) with reconnaissance or humanitarian agencies.
" If they ca n't move because they are too weak , then we will probably consider very seriously using air delivery means ( airdrops ) ...It 's complex , it 's dangerous for air crew that fly in there and it will have to be absolutely necessary.
If it is necessary , I wo n't hesitate to use it , " he said.
Asked if he would disregard objections of (-[-23.656/-2.88/974-]-) Zairean government , he said : " It would have to be in last resort.
It would have to mean that tens of thousands of lives are in danger.
Do you think that I would have a conscience problem doing it or not at that time?
And my mandate is also under Chapter Seven to operate in eastern (-[-23.656/-2.88/974-]-) Zaire."
Under Chapter Seven of (-[--73.9675/40.75/1065-]-) U.N. charter , Security Council has wide powers to preserve peace and security.
" I know their ( (-[-23.656/-2.88/974-]-) Zairean government 's ) position and I know it 's very delicate and we are very sensitive to their position also , " general added.
He denied that his contacts , criticised by (-[-15.313888888889/-4.3316666666667/3838-]-) Kinshasa , with (-[-+23.656/-2.88/974+-]-) Zairean
rebels amounted to negotiations.
" I do n't negotiate , " he said."
I coordinate with those who are holding ground and that 's a wise thing to do.
When we do n't know where front is , we do n't know what risk is."
Baril said that apart from group of 150,000 , and reconnaissance plans had tracked two much smaller groups of refugees -- one of up to 1,000 of town of Masisi and one of up to 8,000 on road from (-[-28.866666666667/-2.5/222279-]-) Bukavu west to (-[-+25.916666666667/-2.95/270225+-]-) Kindu

Finance Minister Alexander Livshits warned financially-troubled Norilsk Nickel on Friday that it must pay overdue taxes , but analysts said firm would not be liquidated or that its would assets would be frozen.
" Norilsk really is a big debtor , both to federal and regional budgets , " said Konstantin Chernyshev , equities analyst at (-[-37.617777777778/55.755833333333/649-]-) Moscow brokerage Rinaco Plus and a Norilsk watcher."
Livshits 's words are an attempt to put pressure on company."
official Itar-Tass news agency quoted Livshits as telling parliamentary deputies that RAO Norilsky Nikel 0#NKEL.RUO had to pay its tax arrears and that bankruptcy procedures applied to metals group.
" If it was an unsolicited statement and a bolt out of blue , then it obviously means something , " said Christopher Granville , chief economist at Bank in (-[-37.617777777778/55.755833333333/649-]-) Moscow.
" But if it was a response to a deputy 's question that was essentially loaded , then it was only answer he could have given."
tax and cabinet authorities , under pressure from (-[--77.044167/38.9/7804-]-) International Monetary Fund to boost tax revenues as a condition for receiving payments of a $ 10 billion , three-year loan to (-[-+37.616666944444/55.75/159+-]-) Moscow
, have been striking fear into hearts of some of (-[-37.616666944444/55.75/159-]-) Russia 's most prominent industrial firms by saying they must pay up or face liquidation.
" They could freeze metal , but it 's not a long-term solution to problem and would n't put money in budget , " Chernyshev said."
I do n't think they would do that."
Entire social infrastructures in icy Far where Norilsk is based depend on company , and (-[-37.616666944444/55.75/159-]-) Moscow has said it has no finances to resettle hundreds of thousands of people -- an expenditure which could far outstrip Norilsk 's debts.
Norilsk officials declined to comment.
Analysts said government , while anxious about Norilsk 's debts , is highly unlikely to bring nickel , copper , cobalt , platinum and platinum group metals producer to its knees or take measures that could significantly affect output.
But it also wants Norilsk , world 's second-largest nickel producer , to clean up its act.
" procedure of bankruptcy will be applied , " Tass quoted Livshits as telling Duma deputies about Norilsk.
It indirectly quoted him as saying Norilsk should first pay salary arrears , which in past have led to worker strikes.
" It is unlikely that Norilsk will pay these debts in near-term -- company will remain a debtor in near future , " Chernyshev said.
He estimated company 's regional debts at least one trillion roubles and said 30 percent of giant (-[-91.666666666667/59.883333333333/6563-]-) Krasnoyarsk regional budget was fuelled by Norilsk money.
Norilsk 's majority shareholder , commerical bank Uneximbank , has said it is reorganising metal exports through Interrosimpex in order to boost revenues.
But changes have yet to improve significantly Norilsk 's situation.
" Uneximbank has inherited a mountain and whether or not they climb out and over it remains to be seen , " said one metals source.
Norilsk said in September that it total debts , including unpaid salaries to workers , were 13 trillion roubles.
company said last month that it had worked out a tax payment schedule with authorities , after regional tax officials threatened to seize some nickel and copper assets.

Plastic surgery is booming , especially among men , as spend much of their new-found wealth on latest beauty treatments , said organisers of a four-day international plastic surgery conference that opened on Friday.
number of plastic surgeries in (-[--53.0/-11.0/155-]-) Brazil has jumped 30 percent to an estimated 150,000 this year since an anti-inflation plan was introduced in July 1994 , Farid Hakme , president of Plastic Surgery Society ( SBCP ) , said.
number of operations on men increased even more -- by 80 percent , from 8,000 in 1994 to 15,000 in 1995 , he said.
" (-[--53.0/-11.0/155-]-) Brazil ranks right at top for plastic surgery with respect to number of surgeons , number of patients , number of operations , number of conferences.
Our statistics are highest for everything , " Hakme said.
" We believe increase in plastic surgeries for men results from difficulties in job market.
People need to have a more youthful look to compete in job market , given profound changes in Latin 's economy."
A controlled exchange rate , trade liberalisation and tight monetary policies have also dramatically curbed inflation , making more money available for cosmetic surgery.
(-[--53.0/-11.0/155-]-) Brazil has been at forefront in plastic surgery for decades and is home to one of most famous surgeons , Ivo Pitangy.
There are 6,000 plastic surgeons there , of which 4,500 have qualified to be members of SBCP.
Every year , 500 plastic surgeons graduate in (-[--53.0/-11.0/155-]-) Brazil and medical students from all over world come to study there.
Hakme attributes (-[--53.0/-11.0/155-]-) Brazil 's fascination with plastic surgery not to excessive vanity but to country 's mix and match of different races , which can create physical disharmonies."
What happens is nose sometimes does n't match mouth or buttocks do n't match with legs , " he said.
(-[--53.0/-11.0/155-]-) Brazil 's most sought-after beauty treatment is liposuction in which fat is sucked away from areas of body , with about 30,000 operations a year at a cost of $ 3,000 to $ 4,000 each.
Stomach tucks and breast operations are also popular since tropical climate calls for flesh-baring fashions , but unlike women elsewhere tend to have breast reductions and buttock implants.
" women who want to reduce their breasts here would probably want to increase them in , " SBCP Vice-President Oswaldo Saldanha said."
Beauty ideals and cultures are different in every country."
Plastic surgery scares like case in which model Claudia Liz fell into a coma after being anaesthetised for a liposuction in October are not much of a deterrent.
Saldanha said operations fell 30 percent immediately after that case but rate was back to normal now.

troops and riot police moved in to disperse a student street protest at a suburban road junction near Ranyon ( Rangoon ) University early on Saturday , witnesses said.
They said police and troops used water cannons from fire engines to subdue about 120 university students sitting in at centre of junction at about 3 a.m. before they moved in to round them up.
students , who had staged an 11-hour protest at junction in (-[-96.15/16.8/37995-]-) Rangoon , were taken away in three vehicles.

About 200 students marched briefly from troubled (-[-96.1172/16.8758/8048626-]-) Yangon Institute of Technology in (-[-+96.15/16.8/37995+-]-) Rangoon
on Friday towards (-[-96.1354/16.83/1185947-]-) University of Yangon six km ( four miles ) away , and returned to their campus , witnesses said.
Seven truckloads of armed riot police and three fire engines were on standby at one of junctions near institute.
There were no clashes.
" They are now back in YIT campus , " an institute official who declined to be identified told Reuters by telephone.
One of two roads leading to (-[-96.1354/16.83/1185947-]-) University of Yangon from institute had been closed by authorities.
But about 300 university students were still gathered outside gates of their campus , witnesses said.
They were singing peacefully.
On Monday and Tuesday , students from institute and university launched protests against what they said was unfair handling by police of a brawl between some of their colleagues and restaurant owners in October.
On Tuesday and Wednesday , opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi was restricted to her home by military government to prevent her from being drawn into protests.
She was allowed to move freely on Thursday.
protest culminated at dawn on Tuesday with several hundred students being detained briefly by police in (-[-96.15/16.8/37995-]-) Rangoon.
street protests were biggest seen in capital since student-led pro-democracry demonstrations of September 1988 when junta crushed uprising.
Thousands were killed or imprisoned.
Earlier on Friday some of students , who were held briefly by police during protests earlier this week , said they were still dissatisfied with military government.
They told Reuters they were unhappy that ruling Law and Order Restoration Council ( SLORC ) had not heeded their calls for right to organise independent unions on campus.
" We still want government answers to our demands.
We want police punishment to be published in newspapers , " one student said.
But students stressed their protests were non-political and they had no contact with Suu Kyi 's National League for Democracy ( NLD ).
Suu Kyi , a Nobel laureate and daughter of independence hero Aung San , and key NLD officials have also denied any link with students.
But they have said both parties had a " moral link " in that they were against police brutality and injustice.
students also demanded government announce punishments meted out to policemen who they said had manhandled students involved in a brawl with some restaurant owners near (-[-96.15/16.8/37995-]-) Yangon institute in October.
students appealed to government not to close institute because of their latest demonstration.
institute was shut for nearly two years after 1988 uprising.
On Friday , road leading to Suu Kyi 's lakeside residence in (-[-96.15/16.8/37995-]-) Rangoon remained closed by police.

Jordan said a small group of developing nations that oppose linking trade talks and labour conditions had pressured World Trade Organisation ( WTO ) officials to prevent Hansenne from taking platform to urge such links.
" It is to their shame that those who are responsible for encouraging this meeting responded ( to pressure ) in silencing him , " Jordan said after opening of an ICFTU conference on international labour standards and trade.

rubber demand seen outstripping production.
1996-12-06
rubber demand is seen outpacing local production in 1996/97 April / March season and trend will persist way into next century , chairman of Rubber Board of India said on Friday.
K.J. Matthew said at Asia Rubber Markets meeting here production of natural rubber in 1996/97 will reach 547,000 tonnes against projected demand of 578,000 tonnes , a gap of 31,000 tonnes.
For synthetic rubber , production reached 68,200 tonnes in 1995/96 while consumption in same season hit 134,085 tonnes , Matthew added.
" Though schemes designed to realise further increases in production of natural rubber are being operated successfully , demand-supply gap is expected to widen , " he said.
synthetic rubber output is not expected to rise significantly in next season but demand will rise to 145,000 tonnes.
Matthew estimates that by 2000/01 season , gap between natural rubber output and consumption will rise to 51,000 tonnes and 319,000 tonnes in 2010/11.
Natural rubber production will go up to 695,000 tonnes in 2000/01 against consumption of 746,000 tonnes.
In 2010/11 , domestic demand should rise further to 1.233 million tonnes while production will only reach about 914,000 tonnes.
One way to bridge widening gap is to put more land under cultivation which Rubber Board official estimates will reach 220,000 hectares between now and year 2003 although Matthew said this may not be possible at this time in (-[-77.0/21.0/668-]-) India.
" development objective for rubber plantation industry will be to increase production to best extent possibly with a view to minimising imports of natural rubber , " he said.

Comments by (-[-136.0/35.0/17-]-) Japan 's tight-lipped bank chief and an influential top bureaucrat are further signs that nation 's authorities want to keep dollar at current levels , market sources said on Friday.
In a rare expression of a view on currencies by (-[-139.7715/35.6861/333101-]-) Bank of Japan ( (-[-+139.7715/35.6861/333101+-]-) BOJ
) governor , Yasuo Matsushita was quoted in (-[-136.0/35.0/17-]-) Japan 's leading economic daily on Friday as saying that he sees no further , immediate fall in yen.
This followed a widely watched television appearance late on Thursday by Eisuke Sakakibara , a high-ranking (-[-139.74926667/35.67288333/1322605-]-) Finance Ministry official , who denied he had said he wants to guide dollar lower to between 108 and 110 yen.
But many in market thought Sakakibara 's real intentions lay elsewhere , and took more notice of his comments about government 's stance on dollar , dealers said.
" I think his views on ( Treasury Secretary Robert ) Rubin 's comments were indeed what he himself thinks about dollar , " said Hank Note , chief dealer at Sumitomo Bank.
Asked about Rubin 's comment that a strong dollar was in interests , Sakakibara said remark does not necessarily mean supports a stronger dollar.
" It 's a strong dollar , not stronger.
In that sense , comments are not pointing to a certain direction , " he said.
" It shows that Sakakibara is not for a stronger dollar either , " said Sumitomo 's Note.
Takao Sakoh , first vice president at Bank of Switzerland in (-[-139.77/35.68/1490-]-) Tokyo , said : " Maybe a dollar at 104.50 yen is not acceptable ( to Sakakibara ) , but it may be okay at current level , at lower end of 112 yen."
Market participants have kept a close eye on Sakakibara , chief of ministry 's International Finance Bureau , as a comment he made in November after dollar hit this year 's high of 114.92 yen pushed currency down sharply.
He had said then that market 's view on (-[-136.0/35.0/17-]-) Japan 's economy was too pessimistic and that he believed it was stronger than market thought.
Dealers have come to refer to 115 yen as " Sakakibara ceiling " for dollar following remark.
Adding to comments by " Mr Yen " , as Sakakibara is known for his prominence in currency market , was (-[-139.7715/35.6861/333101-]-) BOJ governor Matsushita 's remark.
" recent level of yen exchange rate has been stable , and it does not appear to be moving towards a further depreciation of yen immediately , so import prices are likely to stabilise at current levels , " Matsushita said in an interview with Nihon Keizai Shimbun.
" fact that he touched on issue of inflation triggered by import prices shows that (-[-139.7715/35.6861/333101-]-) BOJ does not want a further depreciation of yen , past 115 yen , " said Yasuhito Kawashima , chief forex manager at Toyo Trust & Banking Co.
Some said bank may have been concerned a weaker yen would lead to unfounded pessimism about (-[-136.0/35.0/17-]-) Japan 's economy.
" There was concern that foreign investors may sell stocks if dollar goes above 115 yen.
(-[-139.7715/35.6861/333101-]-) BOJ does not want yen 's weakness to lead to pessimism over economy , " said Taisuke Tanaka , market strategist with Credit Suisse in (-[-+139.77/35.68/1490+-]-) Tokyo
.
Senior (-[-139.7715/35.6861/333101-]-) BOJ officials have separately said financial markets ' views on economy have been too negative.
" I realise there are negative views in markets about impact of consumption tax hike and drop in public spending , but markets appear to be exaggerating magnitude of negative impact , " a senior (-[-139.7715/35.6861/333101-]-) BOJ official told Reuters on Friday.

Lahd , a 69-year-old former army major-general , heads 3,000-strong SLA militia which helps (-[-35.0/31.75/801-]-) Israel hold a border zone in (-[-+35.766667/33.833333/822+-]-) Lebanon
to ward off cross-frontier guerrilla raids on (-[-35.0/31.75/801-]-) Israel.
Lahd said a few days after trial began on February 16 that authorities must drop charges or risk blocking any peace deal with Jewish.
He said (-[-35.0/31.75/801-]-) Israel was capable of pressuring (-[-+35.766667/33.833333/822+-]-) Lebanon
's Syrian-backed government to stop legal pursuit.
charges against Lahd were : forming a hostile army , carrying weapons on (-[-35.0/31.75/801-]-) Israel 's side , helping (-[-+35.0/31.75/801+-]-) Israel
strip off a part of by violence , forming an armed gang , killing or trying to kill civilians by artillery shelling and kidnapping citizens for long periods.
Shortly before Lahd 's trial began , a (-[-35.513055555556/33.886944444444/3820-]-) Beirut military prosecutor charged another 89 former army soldiers with collaborating with (-[-+35.0/31.75/801+-]-) Israel
.
No date has been set for trial of men , all members of SLA living in Israeli-held zone in (-[-35.766667/33.833333/822-]-) Lebanon.
(-[-35.0/31.75/801-]-) Israel and Lahd have repeatedly demanded safety guarantees for SLA -- a mixed Christian-Shi'ite Moslem force -- which Jewish regards as loyal allies.
(-[-35.0/31.75/801-]-) Israel has said army must incorporate SLA fighters into its ranks as an army brigade as a condition for peace.
But political analysts have said that would be out of question and authorities pre-empted issue by taking legal action against Lahd.
Former Prime Minister Shimon Peres , calling Lahd " a patriot " , said earlier this year (-[-35.766667/33.833333/822-]-) Lebanon had insulted SLA commander by ordering his arrest on treason charges.
Peres , who was ousted in May by rightwing leader Benjamin Netanyahu , said there could not be real negotiations with (-[-35.766667/33.833333/822-]-) Lebanon " unless it will stop maltreatment of SLA and its commanders."

Saqr , whose trial was concurrent with Lahd 's , was convicted of " contacting enemy , passing information to (-[-35.0/31.75/801-]-) Israel and undertaking hostile acts against (-[-+35.766667/33.833333/822+-]-) Lebanon

Fourteen years after he bludgeoned and shot a whose trailer home he robbed in 1982 , John Mills Jr.
, 41 , was put to death in Florida 's electric chair Friday.
As Glenn Lawhon , a rural Florida minister who is victim 's father , looked on , Mills was pronounced dead at 7:13 a.m. EST ( 1213 GMT ) for murder of Lester Lawhon.
Speaking in Arabic , Mills made a final statement before an anonymous citizen flipped switch that sent 2000 volts of electricity through his body , said Department of Corrections spokesman Eugene Morris , who was present at execution.
" I bear witness that there is no God but Allah and I bear witness that prophet Mohammed is messenger of God , " he quoted Mills as saying.
Prison officials said they had no record of Mills ' official conversion , but they said that , on May 14 , 1991 , he had asked that a name , Yuhanna Abdullah Muhammed , be added to his prison file , which is usually an indication of a conversion to Islam.
Mills is 38th person to die in Florida 's electric chair since Supreme Court reversed itself in 1976 and legalised death penalty.
Prison officials said Mills made no special request for a last meal and did not eat steak , fried potatoes and orange juice offered him.
He spent Thursday with family members and his spiritual adviser , Morris said.
Mills was scheduled to die Wednesday but had his sentence temporarily postponed by (-[--84.2836/30.4381/3001105-]-) Florida Supreme Court.
On Thursday , 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in (-[--84.390277777778/33.756944444444/23556-]-) Atlanta denied his appeal in federal court.
In March 1982 , Mills and accomplice Michael Frederick knocked on door of Lester Lawhon 's trailer in an attempt to rob it , police said.
Lester Lawhon was taken to a nearby airstrip where he was bludgeoned with a tire iron.
Mills then fired two shots that killed Lawhon as victim tried to run away.
Frederick is serving a 347-year sentence.

A farmhand used proceeds from stolen pigs to lavish tips on dancers at strip clubs and offered one $ 3,000 to pay for breast implant surgery , authorities said Friday.
In sentencing Darrel Voeks , 38 , to a 10-year prison term on Thursday , Outagmie County Circuit Court Judge Dennis Luebke said he was " a thief by habit."
" You are self-indulgent.
You are narcissitic , " Luebke said at sentencing , adding Voeks should pay restitution of more than $ 100,000 to farming family who had hired him.
Voeks , who was already on probation for prior pig thefts , pleaded that he was trying to pay bills for his ex-wife and children.
But court that receipts showed much of money went to dancers at strip clubs where he was known as a big tipper.
One stripper said Voeks offered to give her $ 3,000 for breast implant surgery.

Half of dog bites provoked , says vet.
(-[--87.65/41.9/1297-]-) CHICAGO 1996-12-06
As many as 1 million dog bites are recorded in every year and half of them are provoked by humans , a veterinarian told fellow animal doctors on Friday.
Humane Society of estimates that between 500,000 and one million bites are delivered by dogs each year , more than half of which are suffered by children.
" Most bites can be prevented by teaching children how to respect a dog , " Michael Cornwell of Glencoe Animal Hospital in (-[--82.983333333333/39.983333333333/16567-]-) Columbus , (-[-+-82.5/40.5/1397+-]-) Ohio
, told annual meeting of Veterinary Medical Association.
" Let 's not let our kids jump on them or crawl on them.
Dogs and children do n't have to have an interaction.
Let 's respect their , " he said.
Cornwell said 50 percent of reported bites were provoked by a person and 60 percent were suffered by children.
He also estimated that only 25 percent of bites were reported because medical attention was not needed.
Don Rieck , president of National Animal Control Association , said aggressiveness in dogs was related more to gender than breed and a male dog that had not been neutered was three times more likely to bite than an unspayed female.
five breeds credited with most incidents were chow chows , Rottweilers , shepherds , cocker spaniels and Dalmatians."
trends in dog bites by particular breeds have more to do with fad pets owned by individuals who need to have something unique.
Speaking strictly of dogs , 15 years ago macho fad pet was a Doberman.
Today , Rottweilers are on way up , " Rieck said.
If approached by a stray dog , children should be taught to stand still with fists folded underneath neck , elbows in , and gaze forward until dog goes away.

His sentence had been reduced to 15 years in 1993.

Cyberspace squabbles overshadow copyright talks.

(-[-6.15/46.2/71-]-) GENEVA 1996-12-06
In a gloomy (-[-6.15/46.2/71-]-) Geneva conference centre built before dawn of Internet , groups of staid officials made a first stab on Friday at rewriting copyright laws for digital age.
But critics at first government-level meeting to revise copyright laws in 25 years said officials and legislators might as well be trying to police ether.
After four days of diplomatic wrangling over procedures , some 600 delegates from nations small and large got down to nitty-gritty of setting digital agenda for first time.
Cyberspace squabbles overshadowed debate on a stack of proposals covering literary and artistic works , rights of performers and producers of music and producers of databases.
" If it goes on like this , we wo n't have enough time to finish all discussions , " a frustrated Western delegate said."
They announced they will start evening sessions next week."
Attempts by copyright-based industries to ensure they get a cut from online works led to a storm of protests by Internet companies and critics who say pacts would curb public access to online information from soccer results to stock prices.
" It 's not illegal to make photocopies of newspaper articles.
It 's fair use.
We can read sports statistics or stock prices.
But with treaty , this kind of fact will be owned and subject to licensing , " said James Love , a consumer lobbyist heading Washington-based Consumer Project on Technology.
" None of treaties are ready to move.
These people do n't understand what they 're doing."
At stake are billions of dollars and future of electronic information industry -- coming medium for distribution of music , films , literature , software and commerce.
Supporters of three pacts say they are only an extension of existing intellectual property rights , covered by century-old Berne Convention.
But an array of opponents from network industry to consumer , scientific and academic groups say pacts will give sweeping powers to entertainment and copyright-based industries.
A quick survey at conference centre found few officials who had actually surfed Internet.
(-[-104.0/47.0/711-]-) Mongolia 's copyright official , Gundegma Jargalshaihan , said apologetically that he had just arrived from (-[-+106.91666666667/47.916666666667/23430+-]-) Ulan
Bator and was not aware of details of digital agenda.
" We do n't have money for Internet in (-[-104.0/47.0/711-]-) Mongolia , " he added.
Alexander Bavykin , deputy legal chief at (-[-37.616666944444/55.75/159-]-) Russia 's foreign ministry , said (-[-+37.616666944444/55.75/159+-]-) Moscow
had yet to formulate a policy on copyright in cybersppace.
He too had never browsed Net.
" I 've never tried it and why should I?
There are lots of things in this life I have n't tried either , " he said.
A visit to computer centre offering Internet services found a lone official clicking away on his mouse.
" Internet is a potential cash cow for copyright-based industries and we need roadmaps on information superhighway , " said Marc Pearl , vice-president of Information Technology Association of , a trade association of network companies opposing treaties.
" But there are a lot of dinosaurs here.
People here do n't understand Internet technology.
Because they do n't understand technology , they fear unknown."
Before Internet , those whose business was to protect copyrights knew where they stood.
Their enemies were tangible if elusive , such as people who pirated music cassettes.
But Internet , a global computer network where anything from music to software can be duplicated and distributed at click of a computer mouse , has ripped up rulebooks.
Network operators said draft laws would hold them responsible for copyright infringements in system and expose them to multi-billion-dollar liabilities.
" There are 500 million messages transmitted through Internet everyday , " said Tim Casey of (-[--100.0/40.0/30-]-) U.S.-based MCI Communications Corporation."
How can we control them all?"

A " Euro-sceptic " member of ruling Conservative party said on Thursday finance minister Kenneth Clarke had to resign to prevent party disintegrating over issue of a single currency.
Member of Parliament Tony Marlow said resignation of chancellor of exchequer was only way to make Conservatives electable in a general election which must take place by May next year.
" We have a divided and split Cabinet.
This cannot endure , " Marlow told BBC television 's Newsnight programme on Thursday."
It is not sustainable.
Kenneth Clarke has to go.
If he does n't resign , prime minister has got to fire him."
Marlow 's comment come on heels of speculation that Clarke had threatened to resign if government changed its " wait and see " policy on a single currency and declared it would not sign up for currency in next Parliament.
Clarke denied on Thursday he had threatened to resign and said his position on single currency was in tune with that of Prime Minister John Major.
Major told parliament on Thursday he would keep his options open on single-currency membership.
His statement was interpreted as a significant victory for Clarke and fellow pro-European Michael Heseltine , deputy prime minister.
Pro-European Conservative MP Edwina Currie told BBC that if Clarke resigned , ministers would go with him.

opposition on Friday demanded a high-powered investigation into paedophilia in diplomatic service after federal court forced head of existing inquiry to stand aside.
court said inquiry head Chris Hunt might be biased , since he privately told a newspaper he had turned up no major evidence of paedophile activity , even though he still had months ' of investigation before him.
" Today we are left with a ruinous wreck beyond salvage and a continuing pall of doubt and suspicion hanging over our diplomatic service , " opposition foreign affairs spokesman Laurie Brereton said.
But government responded by pressing ahead with original inquiry , established in May , appointing a head to lead it.
Critics say that if there were many paedophiles in senior posts in Foreign Affairs Department then a secret inquiry would be open to internal influence and would become a public service whitewash.
Accordingly , they demand an open investigation.
A spokesman for Foreign Affairs Minister Alexander Downer said appointment of a inquiry head , administrative law expert Pamela O'Neil , showed government 's commitment to pursue matter.
A report is due in May next year.
One diplomat has been prosecuted this year for having sex with a boy under 16 but was acquitted.
Police have investigated others.
A newspaper reported allegations in April that diplomats had directed government aid to certain foreign orphanages to secure sex with children.

FEATURE - sees prestige in hosting WTO.

1996-12-06
's winning campaign to host World Trade Organisation ( WTO ) 's first ministerial meeting reflected its ambition to play a key role in shaping global free trade , lifeblood of its economy , analysts said.
" As one of world 's most externally oriented economies , has a disproportionately large stake in WTO , " said Desmond Supple , economist at research house I.D.E.A.
" stands to benefit more than most from continued global trade liberalisation as trade is engine of its growth , accounting for nearly three times its gross domestic product."
city-state met opposition two years ago in its bid to host meeting , expected to gather 4,000 officials from 160 countries from December 9 to 13.
In a stand some analysts linked to controversy over 's caning of an teenager for vandalism , then-U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor had said meeting ought to be held where WTO was going to be headquartered.
That would have meant (-[-6.15/46.2/71-]-) Geneva.
But had support of WTO members.
Derek da , senior fellow at Institute of Policy Studies ( ISEAS ) , said 's hosting of conference " carries a deal of symbolism for city-state , underscoring its commitment to free trade and its trading links across globe."
There is international prestige would enjoy , but " more importantly there is a genuine national interest in fostering better global free trade and an open market " , said Tan Yam , head of Business Policy at (-[-103.77666666667/1.2955555555556/738236-]-) National University of.
At ministerial meeting , trade ministers will review work of WTO and implementation of (-[--56.65/-32.733333/77-]-) Uruguay Round free trade commitments under its predecessor General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade ( GATT ).
In June , WTO hailed for its open market policies but and trading powers called on to speed up opening of its services sector.
Supple said struggle that had to wage in vying to host meeting would be repeated during talks.
" There is tension at every step of way , " since a battle line between West and developing countries has been drawn over issue of linking trade liberalisation with labour rights , he said.
Supple said hosting meeting carried prestige for , " however , this is quite intangible as prestige factor may not necessarily lead to any additional investment and trade flows to this."
From a commercial point of view , meeting would be good for 's tourism industry , Tan said.
A large part of 's workforce would be mobilised to ensure meeting would run without a glitch but average " would probably not be too concerned about some of issues , " Tan said.
" But more educated public will realise that these kind of things are important for as a small economy."
Supple said any political gains government would get from WTO meeting -- ahead of a general election due by April 1997 -- would depend on how successful it was in pushing its economic agenda.
" If there are any movements toward freer trade , then 's economy and electorate would gain , " he said."
But I do n't think it would be wise to play up political aspect of this.
I think political issues will take secondary importance to all these economic issues that will be displayed."

's trip to (-[-80.331111111111/26.4725/66568-]-) Kanpur for third test against India has given former England test cricketer Bob Woolmer chance of a sentimental return to his birthplace.
Woolmer was born in of (-[-80.331111111111/26.4725/66568-]-) Kanpur when his father worked there for an insurance compnay and was himself an active cricketer.
" It 's been a sentimental journey ...
A visit to (-[-77.0/21.0/668-]-) India is always an intriguing experience , " Woolmer , now coach , said on Saturday.
Woolmer , 48 , played 19 tests for England between 1975 and 1981.
His first cricketing sojurn to (-[-77.0/21.0/668-]-) India was as a member of Tony Greig 's England side in 1976-77.
His father Clarence Woolmer represented Province , now renamed (-[-80.91/26.85/1498-]-) Uttar Pradesh , in (-[-+77.0/21.0/668+-]-) India

Now aged 86 , Woolmer senior lives with his son in (-[-18.425/-33.925/5465-]-) Cape Town.
Woolmer 's memories of (-[-80.331111111111/26.4725/66568-]-) Kanpur are few and blurred.
" I do n't remember much of place , " he said."
I came here on zero and left at three ( aged three ) when my father was transferred to (-[-88.337777777778/22.541111111111/1348-]-) Calcutta where I spent another four and half years.
" But I do remember we had a cobra snake in basement of our house.
Also that my father bought a bicycle and when we rode over a hose pipe it broke into two."
Woolmer said hospital where he was born is close to stadium where India-South test will be played.

World Cup ski officials hope to be able to get in at least one men 's downhill training run on Saturday in an effort to salvage weekend racing programme.
For third consecutive day , Friday 's scheduled training runs were cancelled due to heavy wet snow and fog on (-[--122.95694444444/50.059166666667/2063471-]-) Whistler Mountain , leaving scheduled World Cup events in jeopardy.
Rules call for at least one training run to be completed before a World Cup downhill race can be staged.
Organisers hope to get that run in on Saturday morning , conditions permitting , and stage race later in day or on Sunday.
" There was no possibility today to make a training run , " said Bernd Zobel , men 's national coach , citing too much snow and poor visibility.
If organisers are forced to run downhill on Sunday , super-giant slalom originally scheduled for Sunday would likely be abandoned.

NHL ICE HOCKEY - RW BURE SUSPENDED FOR ONE GAME.
YORK 1996-12-06
Vancouver star right wing Pavel Bure was suspended for one game by National Hockey League and fined $ 1,000 Friday for his hit on Buffalo Sabres defenceman Garry Galley on Wednesday.
Bure received a double-minor penalty for high-sticking with 2:22 left in first period of Wednesday 's 7-6 overtime win by Vancouver after colliding with Galley in Buffalo zone.
Galley suffered a concussion and did not return to game.
" Mr Bure left his feet to deliver a forearm blow to Mr Galley as he was about to be checked legally by his opponent , " said NHL discipline chief Brian Burke in handing out suspension.
" Although it is clear from videotape that Mr Bure 's actions were a reaction to impending hit and there was no intent to injure his opponent , there can be no excuse for this type of conduct , " Burke said.
Bure , who is struggling with only nine goals and 12 assists in 26 games , will miss Saturday 's home game against Ottawa.
